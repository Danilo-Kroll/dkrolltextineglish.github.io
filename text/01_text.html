<h3>1. Two people chatting at a party</h3>
<h6>Duas pessoas se conhecem em uma festa.</h6>
<br>

[Tom] Hi, my name’s Tom. <br>
[Mariana] Hi, Tom. Nice to meet you. I’m Mariana. <br>
[Tom] Nice to meet you, too. So, where are you from? <br>
[Mariana] Well, originally I’m from Bolivia… <br>
… but my family moved to the United States when I was five years old. <br>
[Tom] Do you live with your family? <br>
[Mariana] Actually, no. My parents live in Mexico now. So, what do you do now? <br>
[Tom] I’m a student at San Francisco College. <br>
[Mariana] What are you studying? <br>
[Tom] History and English. What about you? What do you do? <br>
[Mariana] I’m a sales representative for Xenox Pharmaceuticals. <br>
[Tom] Really? My cousin works there too. <br>
Maybe you know him – his name is Jack, Jack Morrison. <br>
[Mariana] Jack Morrison… Blond, very tall, brown eyes? <br>
[Tom] Yep, that’s him! Next time you see him, tell him I said hi. <br>
[Mariana] Sure! <br>
